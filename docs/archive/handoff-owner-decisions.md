## The two decisions the repo owner made in conversation — LANDED

They existed nowhere but this file, and the two agents mid-flight on them at the previous
handoff left **nothing in the tree**. Both were re-run from scratch and are now committed
in `943d899`. Kept here because they are the *why*, and the commit is only the *what*.

**1. Selective majority-of-3, keyed on measured per-source agreement.** Task 06's gate
fired its stop branch — `ai_involvement` self-agrees only 77.8% on `hn_whoishiring`
against 92.2% on greenhouse/ashby, and it is the cohort's entire targeting mechanism.
Sources measured below a threshold get three extraction passes and a majority vote;
sources above it stay at one. This satisfies both fired gate branches with one mechanism.
Rejected: uniform majority-of-3, a confidence field alone, and proceeding as-is.

**As built:** threshold 0.90 (task 06's own gate line), so exactly one platform qualifies
— **+4.2% of calls, not 3x**. `config/extraction-policy.json`, `extract.vote_facts()`,
and `job_facts.extraction_passes` / `.vote_unanimity` as the stability signal task 11
consumes.

**2. The 40/day extraction ceiling: drain loop with a wall-clock guard, AND fix the
selection order.** Both, not either. `EXTRACT_BATCH_SIZE = 40` against one `extract.py`
invocation in `run-daily.py` capped the pipeline at 40 postings a night against 43/day
intake and 80/day recently. Selection was `ORDER BY first_seen DESC`, which CLAUDE.md
forbids for eval corpora and which was making the same biased selection in production.

**As built:** `drain_loop()` with `EXTRACT_DEADLINE_SECS=3600`, a **zero-progress break**
(without it a rate-limited endpoint re-selects the same batch until the deadline —
strictly worse than one batch), `stopped=drained|deadline|no-progress` in the summary
line, and never-extracted-first-then-FIFO selection.

**`FACTS_VERSION` was deliberately NOT bumped. Task 12 must carry it.** The debt is
recorded at `schema.py:158`.
